    "Seven data tables were collected. The first five were taken from Netflix regarding semi-annual engagement reports starting from the first half of 2023 to the first half of 2025. Each report contains 2 tabs, Shows and Films, and their respective data (i.e. runtime, viewership, global availability). Meanwhile, the IMDb movie/shows data table displays all the movies and shows, each having their own identification tag. The IMDb rating table references these tags to provide each movie/show with their respective ratings and number of votes. The following two IMDb data tables were combined to give us an extensive IMDb table to cross reference with the Netflix reports.\n",
