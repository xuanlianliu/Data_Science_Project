# Netflix Global Viewership Analysis: Data Science Research Project

In this collaborative data science project, we analyzed Netflix media data to determine which attributes have the greatest impact on content popularity. Using Python, we applied exploratory data analysis, statistical visualizations, and hypothesis testing to evaluate relationships between popularity metrics and features such as genre, global availability, and ratings. The project emphasizes data-driven decision making and statistical validation of insights.
